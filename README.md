## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Before jumping into any challenge, it's a good idea to create for mobile-first in mind. I got carried away creating for Desktop that when I looked at my finished product in mobile, the placement of the card was off, due to the huge background-image.


### Continued development

In the future, I would like to fix the mobile responsiveness issues.

### Useful resources

- [w3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Huge CSS resource on the internet. Really helped me to reinforce my knowledge of flexbox/

- [Alligator.io](https://alligator.io/css/box-shadow-examples) - This article on box shadow example really helped me to establish box shadows on the card.
